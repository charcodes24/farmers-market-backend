    <p>This is an alternative way to allow our community to continue to shop at our local farmer&apos;s market by providing them with a safe, social-distancing means for them to place orders through your vendor page and pick them up at a scheduled time Saturday morning.
    <p>
    <p>You will receive an alert during the week when a customer places an order through your vendor page. Please have these items ready to be picked up by Saturday morning @ 9AM!
      You have successfully signed up and are ready to start building your inventory!
      Your username is: <%= @vendor.username %>.<br>

    <p>Thanks for joining and have a great day!</p>
